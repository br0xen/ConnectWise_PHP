ConnectWise PHP Libraries
=========

Here I've got a couple of PHP libraries, one for CodeIgniter, the other a regular PHP class.
CI\_Library - The CodeIgniter Library
php\_class  - The PHP Class
Both work very similarly, view the appropriate README.md in the directory you are interested in.

You MUST have PHP compiled with curl support for them to work.
