ConnectWise PHP Libraries
=========

Here I've got a couple of PHP libraries, one for CodeIgniter, the other a regular PHP class.

CI\_Library - The CodeIgniter Library

php\_class  - The PHP Class

Each has a connectwise.php and a connectwise2.php.
The connectwise.php file is just there for legacy reasons, you should probably use the connectwise2.php one.
CW has updated their APIs several times since I initially created things.

Both work very similarly, view the appropriate README.md in the directory you are interested in.

You MUST have PHP compiled with curl support for them to work.
